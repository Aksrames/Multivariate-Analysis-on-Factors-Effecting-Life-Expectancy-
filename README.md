# Multivariate-Analysis-on-Factors-Effecting-Life-Expectancy-

The aim of the project is to conduct multivariate analysis on factors effecting Life Expectancy and conduct various hypothesis testing 
 using Manova analysis , Multivariate Regression and Canonical Correlation on Total Expenditure , Usage of Drugs, and Immunization 
 rates to answer various hypothesis including what was the highest factor effecting mortality rates.
 
• The dataset is taken from the World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related 
factors for all countries. The data is from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries.
• The multivariate analysis was conducted using SAS procedures(PROC UNIVARIATE , PROC ANOVA) and the result found is that 
the Total expenditure of the country was an important factor determining the mortality rates of a country by comparing 
coefficients of various independent feature
